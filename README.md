# a11y-data-keywords
This is a compiled list of keywords to use when data-mining customer feedback to get the voice of your customers with a disability. The list has been compiled from lists I received from other organizations. I'm going to keep the contributors private per their request. 

## How to use these keywords

These keywords represent words customers may use to describe their experience with your product. While not 100%, these words have a relatively higher likelihood to be used by someone with a disability or uses assistive technology. You can use these keywords to search your customer support database to extract relevant comments. 

This list is not complete. Your organization may have unique words. Take this as a starting point and create an issue or add words to the list and make a pull request.
